# Object Detection and Tracking

A real-time object detection and tracking system built with Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv8.

## Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Identifies multiple objects in a live camera feed.
- **Accurate Tracking**: Assigns unique IDs to detected objects and maintains them across frames.
- **High Performance**: Uses YOLOv8 (Nano) for efficient processing on standard hardware.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodeAlpha_ObjectDetection.git
   cd CodeAlpha_ObjectDetection
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the main application script:
```bash
python app.py
```
Press **'q'** to close the application window.

## Requirements
